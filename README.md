# What we need to do?
* security check for users (eg. 'PATIENT', 'DOCTOR' roles)
* vaccination table in db with info about vaccine, required doses, time between doses, recommended/required status
* reminders for upcoming doses based on the scheduled dates
* notifications for upcoming vaccinations to remind them of their scheduled doses
* enhance user interface structures for activities
